    title: ABOUT ME
    summary: |
           - **Independent**, problem solver, curiosity-driven
           - Strong theoretical and practical foundations in **genomics** (SNP array, KASP markers, next generation sequencing NGS, long read sequencing 3GS) & **transcriptomics** (RNA-seq, single-cell RNA-seq)
           - Developed pipelines for variant calling (QC --> preprocessing --> alignment --> postprocessing --> variant calling --> variant annotation) from large NGS data
           - [I planned the research strategy, designed **workflows in R** for **integrating, cleaning, analyzing and interpreting** **high-dimentional multi-omics data (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, epigenomics)** **via predictive modelling with machine learning (ML)** to predict recombination in *Brassica napus* and documented everything with Quarto for my scientific project (LINK)](https://jamonterotena.github.io/bnapus.reco.ml/gw_workflow.html)
           - Built **software** for processing and analyzing genomic data sets to generate recombination data, e.g., **haploMAGIC** ([link](https://github.com/GoliczGenomeLab/haploMAGIC)) & **haploRILs** ([link](https://github.com/GoliczGenomeLab/haploRILs))
           - Award-winning **communication** ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlufwc6DqV4&t=478s)), **interactive reports** with Shiny for [complex biological data visualization](https://jamonterotena.github.io/The-Impact-of-Oil-Crops/), **static reports** with Quarto for [sharing project outcomest](https://jamonterotena.github.io/bnapus.reco.ml/gw_workflow.html)
